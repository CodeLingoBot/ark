# alloy-go
Experimental Alloy compiler in Go

You cand find the language reference and other stuff over [here](https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy).

## Installing
Requires Go.

	$ go get github.com/alloy-lang/alloy-go
	$ go install github.com/alloy-lang/alloy-go
	$ alloy-go

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

## Styleguide
* Use tabs for indenting, spaces for alignment.
* Use `v` as the name of the struct a method is called on

I'm currently undecided on whether to standardise British or American English.

### Abbreviations
* Statement -> Stat
* Expression -> Expr
